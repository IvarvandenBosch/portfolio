            <p>
                When I first started, I saw react as a big step towards becoming a web developer. I saw the options and loved the reusibility. I wanted to learn it as soon as I could.
                I followed multiple courses and used NextJs for one of the biggest projects I had done until then. I also came across <a href="tailwind.html">tailwind</a> and was immediatly impressed by it's efficiency and how custimizable it was.
                My experience with React or NextJs is currently <span id="exp-time"></span>.
